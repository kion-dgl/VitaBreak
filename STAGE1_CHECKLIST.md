# Stage 1 Completion Checklist

Before proceeding to Stage 2 (Graphics & Polish), verify all Stage 1 requirements are met.

## Build System Verification

### âœ… Completed Builds
- [x] Linux build working
- [x] WebAssembly build working
- [x] PS Vita VPK build working
- [x] PortMaster build scripts created

### ðŸ”² Pending Tests

#### PortMaster Docker Build (REQUIRED BEFORE STAGE 2)
**Status**: Waiting for Docker group permissions after logout/login

**Test Steps**:
1. Logout and log back in (to apply Docker group membership)
2. Verify Docker access without sudo:
   ```bash
   docker ps
   # Should work without "permission denied"
   ```
3. Run PortMaster build:
   ```bash
   cd /home/kion/Documents/BreakOut
   ./build-portmaster.sh
   ```
4. Verify ARM64 binary:
   ```bash
   file build-portmaster-arm64/BreakOut
   # Expected: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, ARM aarch64
   ```
5. Verify ARM32 binary:
   ```bash
   file build-portmaster-arm32/BreakOut
   # Expected: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, ARM
   ```
6. Package for distribution:
   ```bash
   ./package-portmaster.sh
   ```
7. Verify package created:
   ```bash
   ls -lh BreakOut.PortMaster.zip
   # Should exist and be ~1-2MB
   ```

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Both ARM binaries build without errors
- [ ] Package script completes successfully
- [ ] BreakOut.PortMaster.zip created

**If Successful**: Mark PortMaster build as âœ… and proceed to Stage 2

**If Failed**: Review logs in build directories and check PORTMASTER.md troubleshooting

## GitHub Actions CI/CD

### CI Pipeline (All Branches)
- [ ] Linux build passes
- [ ] WebAssembly build passes
- [ ] PortMaster ARM64 build passes
- [ ] PortMaster ARM32 build passes
- [ ] All artifacts uploaded successfully

**Test**: Push changes and check Actions tab on GitHub

### CD Pipeline (Main Branch Only)
- [ ] WebAssembly builds successfully
- [ ] GitHub Pages deploys
- [ ] Game playable at: `https://kion-dgl.github.io/VitaBreak/`

**Setup Required**:
1. Go to repository Settings â†’ Pages
2. Set Source to "GitHub Actions"
3. Push to main/master branch
4. Wait for deployment (5-10 minutes)

## Gameplay Verification

### Core Mechanics (All Platforms)
- [x] Paddle moves left/right with controls
- [x] Ball launches with action button/space
- [x] Ball bounces off walls
- [x] Ball bounces off paddle
- [x] Ball destroys bricks on contact
- [x] Ball speed increases with collisions (2% per hit)
- [x] Ball lost when falling below paddle
- [x] Lives system (3 lives, game over at 0)
- [x] Scoring (100/200/300 points per brick type)
- [x] Stage progression (new stage when all bricks cleared)

### Platform-Specific Tests

#### Linux (Verified âœ…)

## Pre-Stage 2 Requirements

**MUST COMPLETE**:
1. âœ… All 4 build targets compile successfully
2. ðŸ”² **PortMaster Docker build verified** (BLOCKER - requires logout)
3. ðŸ”² GitHub Actions CI passes on next push
4. ðŸ”² GitHub Pages deployment working

**OPTIONAL** (Can be done during Stage 2):
