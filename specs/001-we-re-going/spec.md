# Feature Specification: Breakout Game - Full Implementation

**Feature Branch**: `001-we-re-going`
**Created**: 2025-09-30
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "We're going to want to make a breakout game with the vita library. Sample for the available libraries can be found in @samples/ . We're going to want to make the game in stages. First a blockout with an extremely basic game that we can test works on the vita and compiles to all three environments. Then we're going to want to add simple graphics. Then we're going to want to get the flow for a start screen, gameplay, gameover, game loop, scoring, stages and lives. And last will be adding in more polish with better sprites and game mechanics."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Feature description provided: Breakout game in stages
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Identified: player, paddle, ball, bricks, game states, scoring, lives
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Marked with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Clear user flow: play breakout game on PS Vita
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Each requirement is testable
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Entities: Paddle, Ball, Brick, Game State, Score, Lives
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN "Spec has uncertainties" - see clarifications below
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-30
- Q: How many lives should the player start with? ‚Üí A: 3 lives (classic arcade standard)
- Q: How should difficulty increase across stages? ‚Üí A: More/different brick layouts each stage
- Q: What sound effects are required for Stage 4? ‚Üí A: Full set: all above + UI sounds (button, transition)
- Q: Should ball speed increase as stages progress (in addition to layout complexity)? ‚Üí A: Ball speed increases with hit count, not stage. Later stages use multi-hit/unbreakable bricks.
- Q: What background music requirements for Stage 4? ‚Üí A: Different track per game state (menu, game, game over)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A player launches the Breakout game on their PS Vita. They see a start screen and begin playing. Using the paddle at the bottom of the screen, they bounce a ball upward to break bricks arranged at the top of the screen. As bricks are destroyed, the player earns points. If the ball falls past the paddle, they lose a life. The game continues through multiple stages with increasing difficulty until all lives are lost, at which point a game over screen displays their final score.

### Acceptance Scenarios

**Stage 1: Basic Blockout**
1. **Given** the game is launched, **When** the player starts the game, **Then** a white rectangle (paddle) appears at the bottom, a white circle (ball) bounces, and white rectangles (bricks) appear at the top
2. **Given** the ball is in motion, **When** the ball hits the paddle, **Then** the ball bounces back upward
3. **Given** the ball hits a brick, **When** collision occurs, **Then** the brick disappears
4. **Given** the ball falls past the paddle, **When** it reaches the bottom of the screen, **Then** the ball resets to the center
5. **Given** all bricks are destroyed, **When** the last brick disappears, **Then** the game resets with a new set of bricks

**Stage 2: Simple Graphics**
1. **Given** the game is running, **When** rendered, **Then** paddle, ball, and bricks display with colored sprites instead of white rectangles
2. **Given** different brick types exist, **When** displayed, **Then** bricks show distinct visual appearances

**Stage 3: Game Flow & Scoring**
1. **Given** the game launches, **When** the player sees the start screen, **Then** they can press a button to begin gameplay
2. **Given** gameplay is active, **When** a brick is destroyed, **Then** the score increases by a defined amount
3. **Given** the player has lives remaining, **When** the ball falls past the paddle, **Then** one life is lost and the current life count displays
4. **Given** the player has zero lives, **When** the ball is lost, **Then** a game over screen displays showing the final score
5. **Given** all bricks in a stage are cleared, **When** the stage ends, **Then** a new stage begins with a more challenging brick layout
6. **Given** the game over screen is displayed, **When** the player presses a button, **Then** the game returns to the start screen

**Stage 4: Polish & Enhanced Mechanics**
1. **Given** the game is running, **When** the ball hits a brick, **Then** a particle effect or animation plays
2. **Given** special brick types exist, **When** destroyed, **Then** they trigger unique behaviors (e.g., multi-ball, paddle size change, point multipliers)
3. **Given** the player progresses through stages, **When** brick patterns become more complex, **Then** the difficulty visibly escalates
4. **Given** high-quality sprites are loaded, **When** the game renders, **Then** all visual elements appear polished and cohesive

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the ball is moving extremely fast and might skip through a brick due to frame rate variations?
- How does the game handle the player exiting or pausing mid-game?
- What happens if the player destroys multiple bricks simultaneously (e.g., ball trajectory through tightly packed bricks)?
- How does the system handle screen transitions (start ‚Üí gameplay ‚Üí game over) if the player rapidly presses buttons?

### Key Entities

- **Paddle**: Horizontal bar controlled by the player, positioned at the bottom of the screen. Attributes include position (x-coordinate), width, movement speed, and visual representation. Bounces the ball upward.

- **Ball**: Circular object that moves continuously. Attributes include position (x, y coordinates), velocity (x, y direction), base speed, current speed (increases with collision count), collision counter, radius, and visual representation. Bounces off paddle, walls, and bricks. Speed resets to base when life is lost.

- **Brick**: Rectangular obstacle positioned in a grid at the top of the screen. Attributes include position (x, y coordinates), dimensions (width, height), durability (how many hits to destroy - can be 1 for normal, 2+ for multi-hit, or infinite for unbreakable), point value, type (normal, multi-hit, unbreakable, or special), and visual representation. Destroyed when durability reaches zero (except unbreakable which always deflect).

- **Game State**: Represents the current phase of the game. States include Start Screen, Active Gameplay, Game Over. Controls which elements are rendered, which inputs are active, and which background music track plays.

- **Score**: Numerical value tracking player performance. Increases when bricks are destroyed. Persists across stages within a single game session. Displayed during gameplay and on game over screen.

- **Lives**: Counter tracking remaining attempts. Starts at 3. Decrements when the ball is lost. Game over occurs when lives reach zero. Displayed during gameplay.

- **Stage**: Collection of bricks in a specific layout. Attributes include stage number, brick layout pattern (complexity increases with stage number), brick count, and special brick frequency. Progresses sequentially as player clears all bricks.
